## The Digital Art Composition Book

This is a template [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault that is setup to act as a 'Digital Art Composition Book / Journal'.

Digital art may be 'rigid' and 'not notebook friendly' but this Obsidian vault can wrangle things into a digital notebook that's similar in feel to a paper composition book / journal. It's not perfect but it works well with the constraints 'digital' imposes.

## Additional Details

Please see the [__Using The Vault](Notes/__Using%20The%20Vault.md) file for additional detail how this vault can be used as a digital art composition book. Please note: some links on the `__Using The Vault` page will be broken when viewed from the website but *will* work properly when opened within Obsidian.

There are also screenshots below showing the vault in use.
