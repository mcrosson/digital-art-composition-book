## The Digital Art Composition Book

This is a template Obsidian vault that is setup to act as a 'Digital Art Composition Book / Journal'.

Digital art may be 'rigid' and 'not notebook friendly' but this Obsidian vault can wrangle things into a digital notebook that's similar in feel to a paper composition book / journal. It's not perfect but it works well with the constraints 'digital' imposes.

## Additional Details
