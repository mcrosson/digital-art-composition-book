## Small Tablet Tips / Tricks

An important note: the settings dialog may be too big horizontally for a small android tablet screen. You can drag the top of the window to move it left/right/up/down to access the full window. This is especially important on Samsung Z Fold devices.

On a small tablet it can be wise to use the full screen canvas view and pop-up palette. This allows you to use the whole screen with your stylus and easily access different brushes and recently used colors. Note: the pop-up palette will show your favorite brushes by default and which brushes it shows, as well as how many to show, can be configured within the main Krita settings.

Another helpful thing on tablets is tuning the mutli-touch gestures. The following work very well in practice:

- Two finger tap: activate pop-up palette
- Three finger tap: toggle canvas only mode
- Four finger drag: Undo
- Four finger tap: redo
