## Important Note

Krita can natively import PDFs with each page as a layer. You can simply open the PDF within Krita and then cut/copy/paste each later into a new image as appropriate or work with them as a single image.

The above approch with Krita can be significantly easier and less fiddly than the below.

## Extraction

- Use [pdfcpu](https://github.com/pdfcpu/pdfcpu)
- See command line options
	- `extract -m image` is a good choice
