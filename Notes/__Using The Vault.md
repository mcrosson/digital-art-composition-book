## Viewing on the website

Please note: If you're viewing this file from the main website where the files have been published, some, if not all, of the links below will be broken. These links will *not* be broken once the vault is opened within Obsidian.

## Pinned Tabs

There are a number of pinned tab to ensure users see the most useful information when first opening this vault. Feel free to unpin tabs as desired.

I do recommend keeping the `__Dashboard` tab pinned as it's a great starting point for using this vault, even when used heavily day to day.

## Attachment Automatic Management

This vault is setup to automatically manage attachments. It is configured to ensure all note attachments are stored in the appropriate `attachments` directory under a sub-folder with the same name as the note.

This will automatically move attachments and update links when a note is moved between folders. This is especially helpful as a note moves through the various state/status folders.

You can disable this functionality by disabling the `Import Attachments+` community plugin.

## Folder Indexes

### Attachment Folders

This vault is setup to have "Folder Notes" that index the contents of each `attachments` directory. These folder notes are auto-updated and are a simple index of files within a given `attachments` directory. Simply click on an `attachments` directory to open the index.

### Source Materials Folders

This vault is setup to have "Folder Notes" that index the contents of each `Source Materials` directory. These folder notes are auto-updated and are a simple index of files within a given `Source Materials` directory. Simply click on an `Source Materials` directory to open the index.

### Notes Folder

The `Notes` directory contains a lot of useful information related to digital art. The directory is indexed using "Folder Notes" and the index is automatically updated when new notes are added to the directory. Simply click on the `Notes` directory to open the index.

### Disabling

You can completely disable the directory index functionality by disabling the `Folder Notes` and `Waypoint` plugins. When disabling these plugins, you'll need to manually delete the folder notes within each `attachments` directory as well as the folder note within the `Notes` directory.

If you would like to keep the folder index functionality for only a sub-set of directories, simply delete the folder note for any directories you do not want indexed.

## Comp Book (Vault) Layout

- Different folders for each form of art performed
	- `Coloring`: For coloring pages and related materials
	- `Dot to Dot`: For dot to dot pages and related materials
	- `Drawing`: For drawing and sketches
	- `Ideas - Inspiration`: For ideas and inspiration tracking
	- `Zentangle`: For Zentangle and ZIA (Zentangle Inspired Art)
- Various sub folders to help with organization of files
	- `attachments`: For files that are attached to notes
	- `Complete`: For completed art works
	- `In Progress`: For art that is being worked on currently or has been worked on previously
	- `Prepped`: Materials that will be used for digital art later
	- `Source Materials`: Source files that have been converted or adjusted based on need
- Various gallery notes to help with surfacing information and art stored within
	- Look for files with `_Gallery -` as the start of the file name
- A `Notes` section that has a lot of useful information related to digital art
- A `__Dashboard` note that is meant to be the 'starting point' for the vault.

## Using The Comp Book (Vault)

- Each piece of artwork gets 3 files:
	- The source file for use with a drawing app such as Krita
	- A PNG or JPG export of the file to ensure notes have a good thumbnail preview of the artwork
	- A standard Obsidian note to encapsulate any metadata and notes related to the artwork
- There are a number of templates that can be used to create notes to represent artworks
	- See the `Command Palette` and `From Template` items as well as the `_Templates` folder
	- Each template will place a new note in the main type of art folder
	- Each template will prompt for a number of common metadata items on creation to help auto-fill metadata and other details
	- Each template will have a `To Do` section at the top with prompts for additional steps you may want to take
	- The newly created notes should have the source file and any png/jpg files attached to help with thumbnails and to help keep files organized
- Once a new note is setup with the desired information it should be moved to an appropriate sub-folder to ensure it's auto-added to an appropriate gallery
	- Each gallery uses queries to find the notes shown based on folders
	- You do *not* need to manage the galleries directly
- Art works should flow between sub folders as progress is made. For example: `Prepped` -> `In Progress` -> `Complete` for order
- The `Ideas - Inspiration` folder does *not* have sub-folders and assumes you'll just keep a list of notes similar to the `Notes` section or adjust this area to match your preferences.
- The [__Dashboard](__Dashboard.md) is meant to be 'the starting point' and 'overview' for the whole vault

## Enjoy

There isn't much more to this vault than stated above. Feel free to explore and adjust this vault as you see fit. This is meant as a rough guide, inspiration and/or starting point.

I use this vault for all my digital art and it's been a huge help for me. I hope it, or a variation of it, can do the same for you.
