	- `Drawing`: For drawing and sketches
	- `Ideas - Inspiration`: For ideas and inspiration tracking

	- `attachments`: For files that are attached to notes
	- `Complete`: For completed art works
	- `In Progress`: For art that is being worked on currently or has been worked on previously
	- `Prepped`: Materials that will be used for digital art later
	- `Source Materials`: Source files that have been converted or adjusted based on need
- Various gallery notes to help with surfacing information and art stored within
	- Look for files with `_Gallery -` as the start of the file name
- A `Notes` section that has a lot of useful information related to digital art
- A `__Dashboard` note that is meant to be the 'starting point' for the vault.

## Using The Comp Book (Vault)

- Each piece of artwork gets 3 files:
	- The source file for use with a drawing app such as Krita
	- A PNG or JPG export of the file to ensure notes have a good thumbnail preview of the artwork
	- A standard Obsidian note to encapsulate any metadata and notes related to the artwork
- There are a number of templates that can be used to create notes to represent artworks
	- See the `Command Palette` and `From Template` items as well as the `_Templates` folder
	- Each template will place a new note in the main type of art folder
	- Each template will prompt for a number of common metadata items on creation to help auto-fill metadata and other details
	- Each template will have a `To Do` section at the top with prompts for additional steps you may want to take
	- The newly created notes should have the source file and any png/jpg files attached to help with thumbnails and to help keep files organized
- Once a new note is setup with the desired information it should be moved to an appropriate sub-folder to ensure it's auto-added to an appropriate gallery
	- Each gallery uses queries to find the notes shown based on folders
	- You do *not* need to manage the galleries directly
- Art works should flow between sub folders as progress is made. For example: `Prepped` -> `In Progress` -> `Complete` for order
- The files in the `Notes` section are non-indexed and exist as a generalized list of topics in the file browser. This can be changed to match your preferences.
- The `Ideas - Inspiration` folder does *not* have sub-folders and assumes you'll just keep a list of notes similar to the `Notes` section or adjust this area to match your preferences.
- The [__Dashboard](__Dashboard.md) is meant to be 'the starting point' and 'overview' for the whole vault

## Enjoy

There isn't much more to this vault than stated above. Feel free to explore and adjust this vault as you see fit. This is meant as a rough guide, inspiration and/or starting point.

I use this vault for all my digital art and it's been a huge help for me. I hope it, or a variation of it, can do the same for you.
