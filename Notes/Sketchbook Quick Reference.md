## Important

- The *only* export format on Android that retains layers is `PSD`. Use this format for best interoperability when you want to retain layers.
- The Zentangle template PSD can be imported to the gallery but needs to be duplicated when creating a new Zentangle to avoid directly editing the template.
- Resources, preferences, etc in `Sketchbook` main folder

## General Notes

- Preferences are able to be imported & exported within the Android app, see `Sketchbook` folder current preferences
- The app launches super fast and is pretty much 'ideal' for Zentangle, quick sketches and doodles
- The main Sketchbook website is [here](https://www.sketchbook.com/) and has an `Extras` section with a lot of good, additional brushes, palettes, etc that can be used with the mobile versions of the app
- The `Extras` I use are included in the `Files` section below
- The Android version of Sketchbook is available [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adsk.sketchbook) and the Premium purchase is worth it for the additional features
